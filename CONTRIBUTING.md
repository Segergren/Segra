# Contributing to Segra

A quick, practical guide to get you developing on both the backend (C#/.NET) and the frontend (React/Vite).

## Requirements
- Windows 10 (build 17763 / 1809) or newer
- .NET SDK 9.0.x (Windows targeting)
- Git
- Bun v1.1+ (for frontend tooling and git hooks)
- Node.js 18+ (only if you want the backend to auto-start the frontend dev server via `npm run dev`)
- IDEs (pick what you like):
  - Visual Studio 2022 (17.12+) or VS Code + C# Dev Kit

## Repo Layout
- `Segra.sln` — solution root
- `Backend/` — app services, models, utils
- `Frontend/` — React + Vite app (TypeScript, Tailwind, DaisyUI)
- `libobs-sharp/` — vendored OBS interop

## First-Time Setup
1. Clone the repo
   - `git clone <your-fork-or-upstream> && cd Segra`
2. Install root dev tools (husky/lint-staged for hooks)
   - `bun install`
   - `bun run prepare`
3. Install frontend deps
   - `cd Frontend && bun install && cd ..`
4. Ensure .NET SDK 9 is on PATH
   - `dotnet --info` should show `Version: 9.x` and `OS: Windows`

## Developing
There are two parts running during development: the backend (Photino.NET desktop app) and the frontend (Vite dev server on port 2882).

### Start the Frontend (Vite)
- Using Bun (recommended):
  - `cd Frontend && bun run dev` (serves on http://localhost:2882)
- Using Node/npm (optional):
  - `cd Frontend && npm run dev`

### Start the Backend (.NET)
- From the repo root:
  - `dotnet run --project Segra.csproj`
- Notes:
  - In Debug mode the app expects the frontend on `http://localhost:2882`.
  - If Node/npm is installed, the backend attempts to auto-run `npm run dev` in `Frontend/` if nothing is listening on 2882.

## Building
- Backend (Release): `dotnet build -c Release`
- Backend publish (self-contained optional): `dotnet publish -c Release`
- Frontend (bundle): `cd Frontend && bun run build`

## Linting & Formatting
- EditorConfig is enforced across the repo:
  - Global: LF line endings and 2-space indent
  - C#: CRLF line endings, 4-space indent
- C# formatting (via `dotnet format`):
  - Pre-commit: formats staged `*.cs` files
  - Pre-push: verifies no formatting drift in the solution
  - `libobs-sharp/` is excluded from formatting
- Frontend (in `Frontend/`):
  - Prettier + ESLint with Bun
  - Scripts:
    - `bun run format` / `bun run format:check`
    - `bun run lint` / `bun run lint:fix`

## Git Hooks (Husky + lint-staged)
- Installed at repo root via Bun.
- Pre-commit:
  - Prettier + ESLint on staged files in `Frontend/`
  - `dotnet format` on staged `*.cs` (excludes `libobs-sharp`)
- Pre-push:
  - `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` on the solution (excludes `libobs-sharp`)

If hooks don't run:
- Ensure Bun is on PATH for your Git shell
- Re-run: `bun install && bun run prepare`

## Pull Requests
- Keep PRs focused and small
- Run format and lint before pushing
- Avoid changing files under `libobs-sharp/`
